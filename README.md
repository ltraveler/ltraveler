### Quiet spot with some useful scripts that makes your IDENA indoctrination a shade easier 💡
All scripts has been written as a creative process of understanding how the **IDENA infrstracture** works and all of them are used in the working projects of my shared and personal nodes. If you are donwloading the stable version of any of my scripts there is a pretty high chance to get convenient tool that could save your time in your own **IDENA deployment**.
